# Alt3rnative

This Project is meant to collect and provide resources of knowledge and tools from and for the digital world.
Open-source projects and open communities are the spine of this database.
As the name suggests it's seen to be alternative to your mainstream tools, apps and sources. Still some projects, which are mentioned here, have already made it to the mainstream e.g. LibreOffice.

#### Notice:

The migration of my resources into this project is not done yet. For that I'll be usng semantic versioning, stating how much of my resources has been already added here:

- Major: 1 means I've already migrated all of the local data here.

- Minor:
  
  - With Major = 0: The percentage of the already migrated data. 1-on-1 comparsion.
  
  - With Major > 0: The number of added entries after the full migration.

- Patch: Points fixes or iteration.

The lists are subject to changes, removal or restructuring as the lists get bigger and more complicated.
