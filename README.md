# Alt3rnative

This Project is meant to collect and provide resources of knowledge and tools from and for the digital world.
Open-source projects and open communities are the spine of this database.
As the name suggests it's seen to be alternative to your mainstream tools, apps and sources. Nevertheless some projects, which are mentioned here, have already made it to the "mainstream" e.g. LibreOffice.

#### Notice:

The migration of my local resources into this project is not done yet. That's why I'll be using semantic versioning, stating how much of my resources has been already added here:

- Major: 1 means I've already migrated all of the local data here.

- Minor:
  
   - With Major = 0: The percentage of the already migrated data. 1-on-1 comparsion.
  
   - With Major > 0: The number of added entries after the full migration.

- Patch: Point fixes or iterations.

The lists are subject to changes, removal or restructuring as the lists get bigger and more complicated. I'll also try to keep dead/killed projects out of the list (if you already checked a project and found out that it was killed, then just inform me in the info section)
